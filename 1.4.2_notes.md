## About Python

* Image processing is NOT part of the core language
* Many functions not in the core language is provided by external libraries that people (companies, volunteers) create.
* This is where the import statements come in.
* The instruction manual to use these functions is called an Application Programming Interface (API)

## Primitives

* Programming languages generally provide primities
* Primitives are like atoms- they are basic building blocks
  * Integers - counting numbers without decimals
  * floats/doubles - decimal numbers
  * Characters - a letter such as “a”
  * Booleans - True/False.

## Classes and Objects

* To make complex programs more manageable, you combine many primities into a single structure called Structures
* Example of using just primities
  * Math_grade
  * English_grade
  * History_grade
* Example of using structures
  * Structure GPA
    * Math_Grade
    * English_grade
    * History_GPA
    
## Structures and Primities

Primities
```
peter_math_grade=93
peter_english_grade=82
Joyce_math_grade=86
Joyce_english_grade=95
peter_GPA=calculate_GPA(peter_math_grade, Peter_english_grade)
```

Structures
```
Structure Peter_Grade
	Math
	English

Peter_Grade.math=90
Peter_Grade.english=82
Peter_Grade.GPA=calculate_GPA(Peter_Grade)
```

## Classes

* Classes are structures but also contain methods. 
* In the previous examples, to update Peter’s GPA, we had to call an external function.
* Any time we changed Peter’s grade, we had to remember to call the calculate_GPA function.
* If we forget to call calculate_GPA, Peter’s GPA is incorrect

```
Class Grade
  float  Math_grade
  float English_grade
  float GPA

 calculate_GPA()

 updateMath(new_grade)
     Math_grade=new_grade
    calculate_GPA()

----------------------------------
Peter.updateMath(90) : GPA also gets updated
 
```

## matplotlib.pyplot

matplotlib is used to graph data, including images.  The section that we use to plot is called plt for short.

* img=plt.imread(filename) 
  *Img contains the image data
* fig,ax=plt.subplots(1,2) 
  * fig is the canvas.  It contains graphs.  You show it, hide it, redraw it.
  * ax the actual plot itself.  This is where you stick in your image.
    * ax.imshow(img)

## What to do

1.  Display the cat
2. Explore coordinates\
  a. Whwere is (0,0)\
  b. What is the size of your image?\
  c. What coordinate is the cat?
3. Create a 2x3 and display cat in each
4. Create a 2x3 and put different characters in each

This is the end of the added section.

##  Python/Unix shell commands

```
ls : list the contents of the directory
cd <subdirectory> : change directories
cd .. : go up
pwd : present working directory
[tab] : command line completion
clear: clear the screen
Up arrow : previous commands
```

## 2D arrays in Python

A multi-dimensional array in Python is an array within an array

```
x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]]

x[1] is [4,5,6]
X[1][2] is 6
```

ROWS and then COLUMNS.  Remember this!

## Images in Python

Images in python are a 3-dimensional array (huh?).

Each pixel is made up of 3 (or 4) numbers.  Red, Green, Blue (and a transparency channel called the alpha channel for certain formats)

Row, column, and then [R,G,B,(Alpha)]

So you would address it as  image[y][x][ [r,g,b] ]

```
image[1] : Second row
Image[1][3] : the Pixel at location(3,1)
Image[1][3][1] : the Pixel at location(3,1),Green
```

## Computer Images

The y-coordinates are backwards.  This is from the days of typewriters.  So the top of the image has row 0.  The bottom of the image has row(xxx).

PLTW uses numpy to process images.  numpy is a linear algebra library.

PLTW uses matplotlib to display images.  It is a plotting library.

shape(image) (y,x,pixel)=(rows, cols,pixels)

## Image formats

GIF: Indexed image colors.  Gif uses 8 bits colors.

JPG: Lossy compressed images.  24 bits per pixel.

PNG: Lossless compressed images. 32 bits per pixel

So if you want to have a GIF, convert it to PNG.  PLTW uses JPG but if you want transparency, you must add the alpha channel (to come).
