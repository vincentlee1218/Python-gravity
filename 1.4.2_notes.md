##  Python/Unix shell commands

```
ls : list the contents of the directory
cd <subdirectory> : change directories
cd .. : go up
pwd : present working directory
[tab] : command line completion
clear: clear the screen
Up arrow : previous commands
```

## 2D arrays in Python

A multi-dimensional array in Python is an array within an array

```
x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]]

x[1] is [4,5,6]
X[1][2] is 6
```

ROWS and then COLUMNS.  Remember this!

## Images in Python

Images in python are a 3-dimensional array (huh?).

Each pixel is made up of 3 (or 4) numbers.  Red, Green, Blue (and a transparency channel called the alpha channel for certain formats)

Row, column, and then [R,G,B,(Alpha)]

So you would address it as  image[y][x][ [r,g,b] ]

```
image[1] : Second row
Image[1][3] : the Pixel at location(3,1)
Image[1][3][1] : the Pixel at location(3,1),Green
```

## Computer Images

The y-coordinates are backwards.  This is from the days of typewriters.  So the top of the image has row 0.  The bottom of the image has row(xxx).

PLTW uses numpy to process images.  numpy is a linear algebra library.

PLTW uses matplotlib to display images.  It is a plotting library.

shape(image) (y,x,pixel)=(rows, cols,pixels)

## Image formats

GIF: Indexed image colors.  Gif uses 8 bits colors.

JPG: Lossy compressed images.  24 bits per pixel.

PNG: Lossless compressed images. 32 bits per pixel

So if you want to have a GIF, convert it to PNG.  PLTW uses JPG but if you want transparency, you must add the alpha channel (to come).
