# 1.3.8 While Loops

## And a little review

# Python Syntax Review

## Math

* a=b+c   a+=b  
* a=b-c   a-=b
* a=b*c   a*=b
* a=b/c   a/=b
* a**b  (a raised to power of b)

## Function

```
def    foo(parameters):
  print a
  return 
```

## Conditionals

```
if (a==b):
  print a
elif (b!=c):
  print b
else:
  print c
```

## Strings/Tuples/Lists

* String  a=”hello world”
* Tuple b=(1,2,3,”hello world”)
* List   c=[1,2,3,”Hello”, [4,5]]
* Dictionary d={“a”:1, “b”:2}

## in operator

## range

```
range(10)
range(1:10)
range(1,10,2)
```

# List: Reference or Value

Reference: The two arrays are literally the same

Value: One array is a copy of the other.

Variables inputed into a list or tuple come out as values, so if you update the variable, the list or tuple does not change.

# Python Syntax Review

## Loops

```
for i in [1,2,3,4]:
for i in <list>:
for i in range(10):
  list[i]
```

## Random

Random.randint(1,6)
Random.choice(1,2,3,4,5,6)

# While Loop

## For

You know exactly how many times you want the loop to execute

```
for  i in (1,2,3,4,5):
    print i
```

## While

You do not know how many times you want the loop to execute.  You do it while a certain condition is true

```
i=1
while (i<10):
    print i
    i+=1

answer=[1,2,3,4,5]
i=-4
while i not in answer:
    i+=1
```

# 1.3.8 How to Use a While Loop

Set up your variables
while (test your condition):
    Update your variable

For loops did not require a set up or an update

```
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    print i
```

i  takes on the values of the list.

```
i=-4
while (i<5):
    print i
    i+=1

a=[1,2,3,4,5]
i=0
while i not in a
    print i
    i+=1
```

# 1.3.8 Variable function arguments

```
def foo(name=”Otto Mo Bill”):
    print name

foo()
```

If you do not provide an argument, it will use use default arguemtn.
Output: “Otto Mo Bill”

```
def foo(name=”Otto Mo Bill”):
    print name

foo(“Bea Em The Blew”)
```

If you do provide an argument, it will use use the provided argument.
Output: “Bea Em The Blew”

## number 5

```
x1  def validate():
x2      guess = '1' # initialization with a bad guess
x3      answer = 'hangman word'
x4      while guess not in answer:
x5          guess = raw_input('Name a letter in \''+answer+'\': ')
x6      print('Thank you!')
```

Why is x2 necessary?
You need to initialize in a while loop.  We are using it in line x4

## number 7

It is often useful to consider how many times a while loop will execute. If guess_game(options) is called with a list of 100 options, how many times might the user have to guess?

100 times in the worst case scenario.  This is called a linear search

## number 9

If you change between 1 and 20from the previous program to between 1 and 6000, how many guesses will you need to guarantee that you have the right answer? Explain.

guess_winnder() is an example of a linear search.  If there are 6000 items, it may take 6000 guesses.
goguess() is an example of a binary search.  
If there are N items, it will take

2^x = n, x = log2(n)

If you have 6000 items, it will take 13 tries. 

## number 11

a. How long will it take to guess a birthday?
b. Why do you need to sort the list for a binary search?

a. 365 days in a year

2^8 = 256

2^9 = 512

9 guesses max

You need to know if a number is higher or lower.
