# CSP 1.3.6
## Collections
Variables contain 1 Value.

Collections contain many values

## At A Glance

String - input characters, numbered index, immutable, s="Hello"
List - anything, numbered index, mutable, s=[1,2,'a']
Tuple - anything, numbered index, mutable, s=(1,2,'a')
*Unlike lists, tuples are not changeable. Use parentheses instead of square brackets to create a tuple.*
Dictionary - imput anything, keyed index, mutable, s={‘a’:14,’b’:15}

## String

1. Only contains characters
2. Creating     s=”Hello World”
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element  s[2]    Returns “l”
5. Slicing    s[1:4]   Returns “ell”
6. Changing a letter: Cannot do it
7. Adding: Cannot do it

## List

1. Contains anything you want, including other lists
2. Creating     s=[1, 2, “a”, “hello”, [1,2,3]]
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element  s[2]    Returns “a”
5. Slicing    s[1:4]   Returns [2,”a”, “hello”]
6. Changing an element   s[2]=”boy”
7. Adding an element at the end: s.append(5)
8. Adding an element at the end: s+=[5]
9. Wrong way to add an element at the end s+=5
10. Inserting an element at location 2.  s.insert(2,”boy”)

## Tuple

1. Contains anything you want, including other lists and tuples
2. Creating     s=(1, 2, “a”, “hello”, [1,2,3])
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element  s[2]    Returns “a”
5. Slicing    s[1:4]   Returns (2,”a”, “hello”)
6. Changing an element: NOT ALLOWED
7. Adding an element at the end: NOT ALLOWED
8. Inserting an element at location 2: NOT ALLOWED
9. WHY USE TUPLE? FAST, COMPACT, and can be used as KEYS in DICTIONARIES.

## Dictionaries

1. Contains anything you want, including other lists and tuples.  But use a name as index
2. Creating s={ ‘Jeans’:’Levi’, ‘Dress’:’Forever 21’, ‘Hat’:’Gap’} 
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element : CANNOT 
5. Where to buy Jeans?  s[‘Jeans’]  returns ‘Levi’
6. Slicing : NOT ALLOWED
7. Changing an element:  s[‘Jeans’]=’GAP’
8. Adding an element at the end: s[‘Jacket’]=’Spaghetti Factory’
9. Inserting an element at location 2: CANNOT.  IT IS MEANINGLESS

## Discussion

## Section #8

```
a=10
b=(9,a,11)
a=15
```
What is b? b=(9.10,11)  does not get updated

```
b=(9,a,11)
```
What is b now?   b=(9,15,11) if you type in b again, it will use new a.

Did you see? They made a typo with the code.

## Section #10

What is the difference between
```
values[2]=3  (integer, you can do math)
```
And
```
values[2]=’3’   (string, you cannot do math)
```

## Section #13

```
value=[3,4,5]
```
The following are equivalent and will return value=[3,4,5,6,7]
```
value = value + [6,7]
value += [6,7]
```
The following are equivalent and will return value=[3,4,5,[6,7]]
```
value.append([6,7])
value+=[[6,7]]
```

## Section #15

```
def roll_two_dice():
    die1 = random.choice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    die2 = random.randint(1, 6)
    return die1 + die2
def roll_two_dice_wrong():
    die=random.choice(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,12);
    Return die;
```

## Section #16

```
def guess_letter():
     return random.choice('qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm')
```
