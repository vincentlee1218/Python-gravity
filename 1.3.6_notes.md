# CSP 1.3.6
## Collections
Variables contain 1 Value.

Collections contain many values

## At A Glance

String - input characters, numbered index, immutable, s="Hello"
List - anything, numbered index, mutable, s=[1,2,'a']
Tuple - anything, numbered index, mutable, s=(1,2,'a')
*Unlike lists, tuples are not changeable. Use parentheses instead of square brackets to create a tuple.*
Dictionary - imput anything, keyed index, mutable, s={‘a’:14,’b’:15}

## String

1. Only contains characters
2. Creating     s=”Hello World”
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element  s[2]    Returns “l”
5. Slicing    s[1:4]   Returns “ell”
6. Changing a letter: Cannot do it
7. Adding: Cannot do it

## List

1. Contains anything you want, including other lists
2. Creating     s=[1, 2, “a”, “hello”, [1,2,3]]
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element  s[2]    Returns “a”
5. Slicing    s[1:4]   Returns [2,”a”, “hello”]
6. Changing an element   s[2]=”boy”
7. Adding an element at the end: s.append(5)
8. Adding an element at the end: s+=[5]
9. Wrong way to add an element at the end s+=5
10. Inserting an element at location 2.  s.insert(2,”boy”)

## Tuple

1. Contains anything you want, including other lists and tuples
2. Creating     s=(1, 2, “a”, “hello”, [1,2,3])
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element  s[2]    Returns “a”
5. Slicing    s[1:4]   Returns (2,”a”, “hello”)
6. Changing an element: NOT ALLOWED
7. Adding an element at the end: NOT ALLOWED
8. Inserting an element at location 2: NOT ALLOWED
9. WHY USE TUPLE? FAST, COMPACT, and can be used as KEYS in DICTIONARIES.

## Dictionaries

1. Contains anything you want, including other lists and tuples.  But use a name as index
2. Creating s={ ‘Jeans’:’Levi’, ‘Dress’:’Forever 21’, ‘Hat’:’Gap’} 
3. Number of items len(s)
4. What is in the 3rd element : CANNOT 
5. Where to buy Jeans?  s[‘Jeans’]  returns ‘Levi’
6. Slicing : NOT ALLOWED
7. Changing an element:  s[‘Jeans’]=’GAP’
8. Adding an element at the end: s[‘Jacket’]=’Spaghetti Factory’
9. Inserting an element at location 2: CANNOT.  IT IS MEANINGLESS
