# Unit 2 Lesson 4

There are 3 handouts

Please go into groups of 4

The concepts in todayâ€™s lesson  is on the AP so make so you will have a quiz on this.

# Unit 2 Lesson 4

Encoding Color Images

# Important

1. The concepts in this unit are tested in AP so you will be tested too.
2. You will have to know about pixels/resolution and what they mean\
a. How to find resolution\
b. How to find space requirements
3. You will have to know how the 3 colors (RGB) work\
a. You will have to know first channel is R, second is G, third is B\
b. You will have to know hex code/binary/decimal so if they give you #FF0022 it looks more red.\
c. You will have to know why 1-byte (8 bits) = 256 (0-255) = FF
