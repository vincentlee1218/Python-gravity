# 2.2 Text Compression

## Loss-Less Compression

# Vocabulary

* Heuristic - a problem solving approach (algorithm) to find a satisfactory solution where finding an optimal or exact solution is impractical or impossible.
* Lossless Compression - a data compression algorithm that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.  
* There is a Lossy Compression.  It is used when you are allowed to lose information (Video, Audio, Images)

# Today’s Lesson

* Today's class is about compression
* When you abbreviate or use coded language to shorten the original text, you are “compressing text.” Computers do this too, in order to save time and space.
* The art and science of compression is about figuring out how to represent the SAME DATA with FEWER BITS.

# Importance

* Why is this important? One reason is that storage space is limited and you'd always prefer to use fewer bits if you could. A much more compelling reason is that there is an upper limit to how fast bits can be transmitted over the Internet (speed of light).
* What if we need to send a large amount of text faster over the Internet, but we’ve reached the physical limit of how fast we can send bits? Our only choice is to somehow capture the same information with fewer bits; we call this compression.

# Activity 1

Try Compressing the poem

# Compression Ratio

Compression Ratio = Amount Compressed/Original

Original 93 Characters

Compressed : compressed Text+key: 56 Characters

Difference 37

Ratio 37/93

# Conclusion

The compressed poem is not just the coded part

* If you were to send this to someone over the Internet they would not be able to decode it.
* The full compressed text includes BOTH the compressed text and the key to solve it.
* Thus, you must account for the total number of characters in the message plus the total number of characters in the key to see how much you've compressed it over the original.
 
# Use the Text Compression Widget

Use the text compression widget to compress images.

# Need to know words

1. Heuristic : Rules that you develop by experience
2. Lossy Compression : Compression where you lose information that you cannot ever recover.  Generally used for media
3. Lossless Compression : Compression where you do not lose information,  These are used to send information such as essay, medical data, 
4. Compression Ratio = (orig-new)/orig
