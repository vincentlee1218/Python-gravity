Oh well, the internet is not good. Moving on!

Let's try it!

3rd plan then the internet is so gamefreaked slow

Open Canopy. You're kidding me. It's taking forever to...oh it loaded.
Bring up the Editor.
We might not have a lesson if everything's not working.

I'm gonna hit create a new file.
We're not saving it anywhere.

x = 27
Someone give me a number to put in a decimal.
y = 4.7
z = "27"
xyz. z's mine. don't touch z

These are called primitive variables.
x is an integer.
y is a floating number.
z is a string (notice the quotation marks.)
you can't do z*z
but you can do x*x

the characters in the string are treated as separate character.

w = True

Some computer programs put an arrow
if I can find it.

This is a computer and computer memory comes in mailbox formats called registers and addresses. You don't deal with memory registers; the computer and operating system does it.
If x is equal to 27, what the commputer does is it takes a random memory location and stick a label in a box. IT's going to call this memory location x.

Don't need to deal with x is in location 03.
when x = 27 is run, 27 is stored into location 03.
most important
assignment operator uses the = sign.
math operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Let's do x + 5
That returns 32
Let's do x / 5
That returns 5
Because the answer is an integer, it cut the rest of the decimal points. 

If you do x / 5.0
returns 5.4
As long as one of these numbers is a decimal (float) number, the answer will be a floating number.
what if you have 2

a = 5
doing x / a
returns 5
you're dividing two integers
the code is correct, but you need to change one of the variables to make it a float.

use a = 1.0*a
print(x/a)

If x = x+2
subtract x
gets 0 = 2
this is a contradiction

You can do x = x + 2 and get a result. This doesn't happen in general math.

That's one way to change a variable to a float.
Another way is to convert a variable in the function to a float using the command float([variable])

And here is the problem with coding
float(x/a) will return 5.0
Conversions did take place, but the original operation (x/a) is unaffected. You did not convert one of the variables just yet, you just converted the result.

Explanation:
27/5 = 5 (int)
27.0/5 = 5.4 (float)
float(27)/5 = 5.4 (float)
float(27/5) = 5.0 (float)
See above: 27/5 = 5, so then the float converts 5 instead of 5.4

It looks very similiar to each other, but the problem is that you will find the case 
One small screw-up and the computer program does something absolutely different.
Those small screw-ups are sometimes impossible to find.

Most don't have program experience to look in onto the nitty-gritty details.

# String Operations

Now let's look onto strings.

Let's say z = "5"

a*a = 25
But z*'z returns an error.
z*2 = "55" (output as 55)
The truth: You can't multiply a string by another string, but you can use scalars (constant integer) to multiply a string by a number of times

Ex. 1: What do you think a * z is?
55555 (5 "5"s)

One last thing that I want to show you are strings into ints.

You can't multiply z*z.

# raw-input glitches

5 comes in as "5" as a character.

So we will try int(z)*int(z)
(Don't forget to use print statement)
and get 25

use int(raw-input(...

Here are some basic math operation shortcuts.

a = 5

a+=5
This adds 5 to a.
print a --> 10

a*=3
This multiplies a by 5.
print a --> 15

you may shut down your computers now.
we will talk about function return values.
