## What changes to make
There are several 16.  Each of them mean something different.
We are going to change this program from ft/s to m/s.
The equation (in ft/sec) is
h=-32/2*t*t+v*t+h
In (m/s) is
h=-9.8/2*t*t+v*t+h
Also change all the words into meters

## Variables
Variables store things
x=5 in Python means take the value of 5 and store it into a variable called x
y=”hello world” in Python means take the words “hello world” and store it into a variable called y
Variables can hold : integers, floats, strings, and booleans
Please start variables with lower case and use Camel case letters (flightDuration)
Constants=Fixed values=magic numbers : Use all caps
Booleans (true or false) start with “is” (isWinning=True)
Use single letters for variables you will not use long term.

## Operators
+  -  *  /
x=y+56
z=x+y
z=x**3
Usual rules of math (PEMDAS) apply

## Unuary Operators
x=x+5    means add 5 to x.  Also known as increment x by 5
You can instead replace it with 
x+=5

x=x+6 can also be x+=6
y=y*12 can be y*=12
z=z/h can also be z/=h
t=t-x can also be t-=x

For counting numbers, we frequently add 1 or subtract one.  There is an even bigger shortcut
for x=x+1 you can use x+=1 or x==
for x=x-1 you can use x-=1 or x--

## Function return values
def function():
    return 5
Returns the value 5.
def function():
	return “hello world”
Returns the phrase “hello world”

## Function Parameters
To pass parameters to function, you use parameters
def function(variables):
     return variables

# 1.3.3 Branching and Output

## 4,6 Multiple Assignment

The = takes the right hand side and puts it into the left hand side
	x=15
	y=-3.25
Python allows multiple assignments
	x,y=(3,-1.5)
X is now 3 and y is now -1.5

## 3 Conditionals

Testing or conditions: You use the following to test

a == b : equal to
a != b : not equal to
a < b : less than
a <= b : less than or equal to
a > b : greater than
a >= b : greater than or equal to

The result is a boolean ( either True or False )

## Data types and comparison

```
a=”hello”
b=”world”
a<b
```

returns False
a<b means “does a come before b in the dictionary”


FLOATS:
NEVER test floats for equality.
a=0.5
b=0.5
Never test for == or !=
the reason is because the precision of floats returns an infinite binary number and there is a small margin of error

```
a=0.1+0.2
b=0.15+0.15
print a-b
```

a-b should be 0, but the computer returns
```
5.55111512313e-17
```

only >= and <= are used for comparing floats

## 3 Compound conditionals s	and and or

You can combine several tests:  For and to be true, both must be true.  For or to be true, only one can be true.

(3<5) and (5<4) is False
(3<5) or (5<4) is True
(3<5) and (5>4) is True
(3>5) or (5<4) is False

## 3 Truth tables: a formal presentation

And

A|B|A and B
T|T|T
T|F|F
F|T|F
F|F|F

Or

A|B|A or B
T|T|T
T|F|T
F|T|T
F|F|F

## 6 Conditional Statements

```
if (True):
    Do something 1
    Do something 2
else:
  	 Do different thing 1
    Do different thing 2
```

Replace True with a test.

```
if (x<5 and x>-2):
	print(“Nice X”)
	print (“ Find a y”)
Else:
	print(“Too bad”)
	Print (“So sad”)
```

## 7-9 Collections (why is this here?)

Variables generally contain one item.  You can create a variable that contains a collection of items.
a=[“monkey”,”dog”,”cat”]
Then you can use in to see if an item is in that collection
“monkey” in a
“donkey” in a

## 7-9 Collections (b)

```
if (“monkey” in a):
    print (“ Your mingkey needs a license”)
else:
   print(“ Do you take me for a fuel?”)
(ref https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlIWpZSPXU) 
```

## Exercise 1

```
x=int(input("Type in a number"))

if ((x<5 and (x>-2)):
	print("Nice X")
	print("y did you break up?")
else:
	print("No good")
```

Oh well, the internet is not good. Moving on!

Let's try repl.it

The internet is so slow. Moving on to Plan C.

Open Canopy. You're kidding me. It's taking forever to...oh it loaded.
Bring up the Editor.
We might not have a lesson if everything's not working.

I'm gonna hit create a new file.
We're not saving it anywhere.

x = 27
Someone give me a number to put in a decimal.
y = 4.7
z = "27"
xyz. z's mine. don't touch z

These are called primitive variables.
x is an integer.
y is a floating number.
z is a string (notice the quotation marks.)
you can't do z*z
but you can do x*x

the characters in the string are treated as separate character.

w = True

Some computer programs put an arrow
if I can find it.

This is a computer and computer memory comes in mailbox formats called registers and addresses. You don't deal with memory registers; the computer and operating system does it.
If x is equal to 27, what the commputer does is it takes a random memory location and stick a label in a box. IT's going to call this memory location x.

Don't need to deal with x is in location 03.
when x = 27 is run, 27 is stored into location 03.
most important
assignment operator uses the = sign.
math operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Let's do x + 5
That returns 32
Let's do x / 5
That returns 5
Because the answer is an integer, it cut the rest of the decimal points. 

If you do x / 5.0
returns 5.4
As long as one of these numbers is a decimal (float) number, the answer will be a floating number.
what if you have 2

a = 5
doing x / a
returns 5
you're dividing two integers
the code is correct, but you need to change one of the variables to make it a float.

use a = 1.0*a
print(x/a)

If x = x+2
subtract x
gets 0 = 2
this is a contradiction

You can do x = x + 2 and get a result. This doesn't happen in general math.

That's one way to change a variable to a float.
Another way is to convert a variable in the function to a float using the command float([variable])

And here is the problem with coding
float(x/a) will return 5.0
Conversions did take place, but the original operation (x/a) is unaffected. You did not convert one of the variables just yet, you just converted the result.

Explanation:
27/5 = 5 (int)
27.0/5 = 5.4 (float)
float(27)/5 = 5.4 (float)
float(27/5) = 5.0 (float)
See above: 27/5 = 5, so then the float converts 5 instead of 5.4

It looks very similiar to each other, but the problem is that you will find the case 
One small screw-up and the computer program does something absolutely different.
Those small screw-ups are sometimes impossible to find.

Most don't have program experience to look in onto the nitty-gritty details.

# String Operations

Now let's look onto strings.

Let's say z = "5"

a*a = 25
But z*'z returns an error.
z*2 = "55" (output as 55)
The truth: You can't multiply a string by another string, but you can use scalars (constant integer) to multiply a string by a number of times

Ex. 1: What do you think a * z is?
55555 (5 "5"s)

One last thing that I want to show you are strings into ints.

You can't multiply z*z.

# raw-input glitches

5 comes in as "5" as a character.

So we will try int(z)*int(z)
(Don't forget to use print statement)
and get 25

use int(raw-input(...

Here are some basic math operation shortcuts.

a = 5

a+=5
This adds 5 to a.
print a --> 10

a*=3
This multiplies a by 5.
print a --> 15

you may shut down your computers now.
we will talk about function return values tomorrow.


When you input 3, it comes in as "3" (in quotaiton marks). This is not a number. You must convert it to a number for it to work in functions.

WHen you're writing code, you will have a huge section of code and you have absolutely no idea of what the code is doing. You need to run throguh this code step by step. It's like creating a knot and then trying to unravel it.
