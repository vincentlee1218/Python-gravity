# 1.4.3 Notes

Multi-dimensional Arrays

# A 1-dimensional Array

```
A=[11,21,31,41]
```

A[0] is 11

A[1] is 21

# A 2-diemsional Array

```
B=[ [11,12,13]
    [21,22,23]
    [31,32,33] ]
```

B[1] is [21,22,23]

B[1][0] is 21

B[2][0] is 31

# An image is a 3-dimensional Array

```
C=[  [ [r1,g1,b1], [r2,g2,b2], [r3,g3,b3] ]
     [ [r1,g1,b1], [r2,g2,b2], [r3,g3,b3] ] ]
```

C[0][2] is [r3,g3,b3] 

# Pixels

```
[ [[0,0,0], [0,0,0],[0,0,0] ]
  [[0,0,0],[255,0,0],[0,255,0]] ]
```

The output is black, black, black in the first row and black, red, green in the second row.

# Channels

```
[ [[0,0,0], [0,0,0],[0,0,0] ]
  [[0,0,0],[255,0,0],[0,255,0]] ]
```

You can pull out channels (just the colors.

```
Red channel
[  [0,0,0]
[0,255,0] ]

Green Channel
[ [0,0,0]
  [0,0,255] ]

Blue Channel
[ [0,0,0]
  [0,0,0] ]
```

# Objects and packages.

If you call a method that belongs to an object you use a dot.

```
Fido.bark()
```

But if you import a package that provides functions, you call the function with the same convention.

```
plt.imread()
```
