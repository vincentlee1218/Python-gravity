# 1.4.3 Notes

Multi-dimensional Arrays

# A 1-dimensional Array

```
A=[11,21,31,41]
```

A[0] is 11

A[1] is 21

# A 2-diemsional Array

```
B=[ [11,12,13]
    [21,22,23]
    [31,32,33] ]
```

B[1] is [21,22,23]

B[1][0] is 21

B[2][0] is 31

# An image is a 3-dimensional Array

```
C=[  [ [r1,g1,b1], [r2,g2,b2], [r3,g3,b3] ]
     [ [r1,g1,b1], [r2,g2,b2], [r3,g3,b3] ] ]
```

C[0][2] is [r3,g3,b3] 

# Pixels

```
[ [[0,0,0], [0,0,0],[0,0,0] ]
  [[0,0,0],[255,0,0],[0,255,0]] ]
```

The output is black, black, black in the first row and black, red, green in the second row.

# Channels

```
[ [[0,0,0], [0,0,0],[0,0,0] ]
  [[0,0,0],[255,0,0],[0,255,0]] ]
```

You can pull out channels (just the colors.

```
Red channel
[  [0,0,0]
[0,255,0] ]

Green Channel
[ [0,0,0]
  [0,0,255] ]

Blue Channel
[ [0,0,0]
  [0,0,0] ]
```

# Objects and packages.

If you call a method that belongs to an object you use a dot.

```
Fido.bark()
```

But if you import a package that provides functions, you call the function with the same convention.

```
plt.imread()
```

# Activity

Things to learn today

1. What do the variables contain?
2. How do you display images
3. How do you get the red green blue values of individual pixels?
4. How do you change the red green blue values of individual pixels?
5. How do you use conditional changes?

Things to try
1. Add blocks of color
2. Change the color of the rings
3. Move the one of the rings
4. Change color of Thanos
5. Move Thanos
6. Extend
7. Create a canvas
8. Add Hulk and Thanos in one image
9. Use alpha channels to "ghostify"
