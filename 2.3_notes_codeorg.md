Image Encoding

# This is not a direct AP Topic 

This is probably not a direct AP topic.  It is background but interesting.

The third topic (optional) is not important at all to this course but most interesting to people.

# Pre Encoding Images

Remember

1.Information in the internet transfers as a series of 1’s and 0’s
2. Suppose 0=black, 1=white.  If you get 12 number 110100110001 

* How many bits per pixel (for BW you only need 1 BPP so you have a 12 pixel image)
* What is the dimension of the image? 1x12, 2x6,3x4, 4x3,6x2,12,x?

# Important concepts

These are test vocabulary words

1. Pixel : A small rectangular/or square block with a single color that comes together to form an image.
2. Metadata :  Information about data. 

Data: The images to the left\
Metadata: \
Painter: Leonardo da Vinci\
Size  77 cm × 53 cm\
Datec 1517\
Location: Louvre\

# 1. Invent an image encoding scheme

1. Use: Invent a B&W Encoding Scheme handout
2. In pairs, figure out how you would encode the two images on page 1 as a series of 0 and 1 so anyone who opens it can recover the imageit.   (you need exact, how many bits, how many bytes….)
3. Once you have tried it on page 1, turn your paper over and see if your scheme works for the 4 images in the back.
4. (Optional) Can you figure out how you can compress the data?
5. (Optional) How does your scheme handle massive images where you do not know the size?  Recall 8 bits gives you 255.  For a small image that is a waste.

# Example

Image of Hong Kong (10000 by 7000)

Sydney at night, if you zoom in you can see people (look for image that says click for larger)
