# 1.3.7 For loops

## How to go loopy in Python.

## For loops

Execute instructions multiple times.  You must give it a list

```
for items in [1,2,3,4]:
    Do this
    Do some more
    Do this too
```

You must give it a list.
You must have the colon
Anything you want done must be indented.  Remove the indent to stop

## For loops with an existing list/tuple

```
Chopin_liszt=['nocturne', 'dances', 'sonata']
for composers in Chopin_liszt:
    Do something
    Do something else
You can stop now
```

You can have a pre-existing list defined as a variable. Insert the variable instead of a list.

Remove the indent to end the For statement. (On a TI-Basic programming language use the end command because indents are not supported.)

## Home on the range

To use the range( function use the following syntax:

range([start,]end[,step])

Examples:

range(10) - integers from 0 to 9
  10 is not included in range

range(3,10) - integers from 3 to 9 (does not include the 10!)
  starts at 3 and ends at 10

range(3,10,2) - integers from 3 to 9 count by 2 - 3,5,7,9
  start at 3, end at 10, count by 2
  
## Numbered loopiness

Use numbered loops with lists

```
rhapsody=['Hungarian', 'Bohemian', 'in Blue']
for song in rhapsody:
    print song

for i in range(3):
    print rhapsody[i]

for i in range( len(rhapsody)):
    print rhapsody[i]
```
